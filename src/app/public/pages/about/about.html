        <p class="text-muted fs-5" style="color:#6b5e52;">
          Hi! I’m Ashya, a ceramics artist from Wroclaw, now living in the beautiful city of Hamburg. 
          Ceramics have truly changed my life. From the first moment, I was captivated by the ability to create beautiful 
          and functional objects with my own hands. The joy of making everyday items that I could use and appreciate brought 
          immense happiness to my life. I love to make the space around me not only functional but as well unique and 
          unforgettably beautiful.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted fs-5" style="color:#6b5e52;">
          My work is inspired by nature. Sand, sea, and rocks are the elements I strive to preserve in my art. 
          Imagine walking barefoot on warm sand by the seaside, somewhere on a wild, secluded beach. 
          Alone, you feel the sun on your skin and the wind in your hair. You feel free because you are truly living in the moment. 
          This is the feeling I get from my art and I wish to share with people when they use my ceramics.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted fs-5" style="color:#6b5e52;">
          In 2022, I opened my atelier with the hope of sharing the joy of ceramics with others. 
          Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced ceramics enthusiast, my classes are 
          tailored to meet your individual needs. I believe in working closely with each participant 
          to ensure a fun and creative experience.
        </p>

        <p class="text-muted fs-5" style="color:#6b5e52;">
