    <p>
      The contents of our website have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the
      accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our
      own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 (1) DDG. According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, however, we are
      not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances
      that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general
      laws remain unaffected. Liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a

      Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no control.
      Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for such external content. The respective provider or
      operator of those sites is always responsible for the content. The linked pages were checked for possible
      legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at that time. A permanent
      monitoring of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon
      notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.

      violations, we will remove such content immediately.
